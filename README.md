Biology is a large field with many subfields, and it is impossible to prepare an
exhaustive list of papers that cover critical discoveries across all of them. We
are not going to attempt that here. At best, this list is only relevant in
context of my own research interests and opinons, and partly serves to simply
catalog them for archival purposes. However, the listed papers should be an
enjoyable read nonetheless, in the hope that you'd like them as much as I did.
